Android Applications using App Patterns such as MVP, MVVM, and maybe 
even Flux.

# SENIOR ANDROID DEVELOPER NOTE

1. Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture patterns was specifically designed for 
   web applications. AND, most Application Architecture had their definition 
   of origin in either desktop or server environments very different from 
   mobile. Hence, some of the things you will not find in these application 
   architecture pattern libraries is a COMMAND LAYER API, etc as one has 
   to make some smart choices here of what belongs in the Android Application 
   environment.
